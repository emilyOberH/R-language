Set of exercises solved in R

    Lab 1:
  1) Program creates two vectors, each storing the amount of a good that was sold in the last six days. Program then calcultes the profit each person made by multiplying each person's vector by their price and sums all entries. Then the total profit of both vectors is displayed. 
  
    Lab 2:
  1) Find three different ways to create a vector with elements: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
  2) Create a vector of 20 positive random numbers.
  3) Display numbers from 1 to 20 as a cube.
  4) In a given integer vector find the square of elements greater than 5. Do not enter a new variable.
  5) Let a <- c(-1,0,5,33,2,-3,6,8) and b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE,TRUE, FALSE,TRUE, FALSE), what will be the output for the R expression max(a[b])?
  6) Write an R expression that will return the positions of 3 and 8 in the vector x <- c(1, 3, 6, 7, 3, 7, 8, 9, 3, 8, 8, 2, 3, 3)
  7) Write some R code that will generate a vector with the following elements "ae" "bd" "cc" "db" "ea"

  9) Create a character vector consisting of 10 symbols denoting gender(F, M). Then generate a vector of positive numbers that will store the pay of people from 1200zł to 10000zł. Then create a vector in which you will convert the women's salary to Euros.
